    <h1>Kata: Transportation on vacation</h1>
    <h2>Open the console</h2>
    <p>
      After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a
      vacation. <br />
      So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all
      the <br />
      mess behind you.<br />
      <br />
      You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your
      vacation. The <br />
      manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.<br />
      <br />
      Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more
      days, <br />
      you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or
      more days, <br />
      you get $20 off your total.<br />
      <br />
      Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).<br />
